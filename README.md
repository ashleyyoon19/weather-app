# The Odin Project: Weather App

Pulled the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/) & [IPData API](https://ipdata.co/) to create a user-friendly weather app using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Features of the app:
1. Detects city visitor is in via IP address and sets it to default in regards to their local date, time, and weather;
2. Provides weather information, such as the description, wind speed, and humidity;
3. Changes the weather icon based on the city's weather description;
4. Changes the background image based on the visitor's local time;
5. Provides a search bar for users to search other cities' weather.
